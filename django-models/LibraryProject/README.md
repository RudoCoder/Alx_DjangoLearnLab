Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It adheres to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle, promoting code reusability and efficiency.
Key Features and Concepts:
MVT (Model-View-Template) Architecture:
Model: Defines the data structure, typically mapping to a database.
View: Handles requests, interacts with the model, and selects the appropriate template.
Template: Defines the structure and layout of the web page, often using HTML with Django's templating language for dynamic content.
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):
Allows interaction with databases using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries, simplifying data management.
Built-in Admin Interface:
Provides an automatic, customizable administrative interface for managing website data, reducing development time.
Security Features:
Includes built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
URL Routing:
Maps URLs to specific views, defining how different parts of the application are accessed.
Form Handling:
Simplifies the creation, validation, and processing of web forms.
Authentication and Authorization:
Provides robust mechanisms for user management, including login, logout, and permission control.
Scalability:
Designed to handle projects of varying sizes, from small applications to large-scale enterprise solutions.
Reusable Apps:
Encourages the creation of modular, self-contained applications that can be easily integrated into different projects.
Development Workflow:
Project Setup: Create a Django project and one or more applications within it.
Define Models: Design your database schema using Django's ORM, defining classes that represent database tables.
Create Views: Write Python functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return responses.
Configure URLs: Map URLs to your views in urls.py files.
Develop Templates: Create HTML templates to render dynamic content using Django's template language.
Manage Static Files: Configure how static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are served.
Database Migrations: Use Django's migration system to manage changes to your database schema.
Deployment: Deploy your Django project to a web server.
